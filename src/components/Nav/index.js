//We could choose to hardcode all of the categories, but that would lead to 
//less DRY code. Instead, we'll use the .map() function inside a JSX expression. 
//First we'll define the categories in an array above the return statement. 
//Instead of just listing each category's name, we'll create objects that 
//contain each category's name and a short description. That way, we can use 
//that same data elsewhere in the app.

//Whenever we map over anything in JSX, the outermost element must have a key 
//attribute that's set to be something unique. This helps React keep track of 
//items in the virtual DOM.  We've seen object keys and primary/foreign keys 
//used to uniquely identify properties or items in a database.

//In this case, we used category.name because we don't expect any categories to 
//share the same name. Often the key will be an id.

//Note also the use of parentheses in the map callback to return JSX. 
//When you map over an array in a JSX expression, you should return only a
// single JSX elementâ€”like how you can only return a single element from a 
//React component.

    // function, and the second argument is an array with a single element, 
    //currentCategory. The second argument directs the hook to re-render the

    //currentCategory changes now, the component will re-render so that the change 
    //in document.title will be visible to the user.
