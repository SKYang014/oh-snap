//Notice that we named the function ContactForm, not Contact. The name
//of this function isn't critical and doesn't have to match the name 
//of the component folder. But the name of the function needs to be 
//in the export statement.

    const [formState, setFormState] =
        //, formState will have three key-value pairs to represent the three user 
        //inputs: name, email, and message. Now let's add the defaultValue attribute 
        //to each of the three form elements that'll handle form data. With this 
        //attribute, we can assign the initial state values to the input fields in 
        //the DOM, 
        useState({ name: '', email: '', message: '' });

    //A feature of this Hook is the ability to initialize the values of the 
    //state. In this case, we want to clear the input fields on the component 
    //loading. Thus, we'll set the initial state to empty strings,
    const { name, email, message } = formState;
    //we're using the setFormState function to update the formState value for 
    //the name property. We assign the value taken from the input field in the
    // UI with e.target.value and assign this value to the property 
    //formState.name. We use the spread operator, ...formState, so we can 
    //retain the other key-value pairs in this object. Without the spread 
    //operator, the formState object would be overwritten to only contain
    // the name: value key pair.

    //Note that console.log(formState) is located outside the handleChange 
    //function declarationâ€”because the asynchronous nature of the setFormState 
    //function will cause the console.log placed in the function body of
    // handleChange to appear delayed in its ability to sync. However, when we
    // place the console.log in the scope of the ContactForm function, we can
    // see that the state is updated properly
    function handleChange(e) {
        setFormState({ ...formState, [e.target.name]: e.target.value })
    }

    //console.log(formState);  showed rt updates

    //This function should look straightforward. We'll prevent the default action 
    //of the form Submit button and then log the formState object on the Submit 
    //button click
