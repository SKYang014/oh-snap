          <React.Fragment></React.Fragment>.

          They're a useful tool in React to allow multiple elements to be grouped
          together. Although in JSX you can only return a single parent element, 
          this rule can be satisfied by wrapping the children components in a 
          React fragment. This also allows you to wrap elements without creating 
           extra DOM nodes, like wrapping with a <div> would do. */}

//React components must always return a single parent JSX element.
//However, this element may have many children elements.

//Inside the function, it seems that HTML is all that's returned. But
//actually, it's not HTML; it's a language called JSX that can represent 
//HTML in JavaScript. Normally you can't add HTML to JavaScript, at least 
//without making it a string. But it won't break the code in this case, 
//because you're using webpack and React. Think of functions that return 
//JSX as functions that use document.createElement(JSX). In fact, the way 
//React uses JSX behind the scenes is very similar to document.createElement().
